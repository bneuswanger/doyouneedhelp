        <h1>Do You Need Help?</h1>
        <p>Every now and then, in online chat rooms I hang around in, someone pops in and says something in the lines of:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <span class="name">Student:</span>
            <p class="message">Any JavaScript experts around?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is bad form, for several reasons. What the person is <em>actually</em> asking here is,</p>
        <blockquote>
            <span class="name">Student:</span>
            <p class="message">Any JavaScript experts around who are willing to commit into looking into my problem, whatever that may turn out to be, even if it's not actually related to JavaScript or if someone who doesn't know anything about JavaScript could actually answer my question?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>There are plenty of reasons why people who DO have the knowledge would not admit to it. By asking, you're asking for more than what you think you're asking.</p>
        <p>You're asking people to take responsibility. You're questioning people's confidence in their abilities. You're also unnecessarily walling other people out. I often answer questions related to languages or libraries I have never used, because the answers are (in a programmer kind of way) common knowledge.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, it can be seen as...</p>
        <blockquote>
            <span class="name">Student:</span>
            <p class="message">I have a question about JavaScript but I'm too lazy to actually formalize it in words unless there's someone on the channel who might be able to answer it.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>...which is just lazy. If you're not willing to do the work to solve your problem, why should we?</p>
        <p>The solution is not to ask to ask, but just to ask. Someone who is idling on the channel and occasionally glances at what's going on is unlikely to answer your "asking to ask" question, but your actual problem description may pique their interest and get them to answer.</p>
        <p>So, to summarize, don't ask <em>"Any JavaScript experts around?"</em>, but rather ask <em>"How do I [problem] with JavaScript and [other relevant info]?"</em></p>
